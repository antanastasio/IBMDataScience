```

    /resources/data/Example1.txt: No such file or directory

<h2 id="read">Reading Text Files</h2>


One way to read or write a file in Python is to use the built-in <code>open</code> function. The <code>open</code> function provides a **File object** that contains the methods and attributes you need in order to read, save, and manipulate the file. In this notebook, we will only cover **.txt** files. The first parameter you need is the file path and the file name. An example is shown as follow:


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/ReadOpen.png" width="500" />


The mode argument is optional and the default value is **r**. In this notebook we only cover two modes:

<ul>
    <li>**r**: Read mode for reading files </li>
    <li>**w**: Write mode for writing files</li>
</ul>


For the next example, we will use the text file **Example1.txt**. The file is shown as follows:


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/ReadFile.png" width="100" />


We read the file:



```python
# Read the Example1.txt

example1 = "Example1.txt"
file1 = open(example1, "r")
```

We can view the attributes of the file.


The name of the file:



```python
# Print the path of file

file1.name
```




    'Example1.txt'



The mode the file object is in:



```python
# Print the mode of file, either 'r' or 'w'

file1.mode
```




    'r'



We can read the file and assign it to a variable :



```python
# Read the file

FileContent = file1.read()
FileContent
```




    'This is line 1 \nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3'



The **/n** means that there is a new line.


We can print the file:



```python
# Print the file with '\n' as a new line

print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The file is of type string:



```python
# Type of file content

type(FileContent)
```




    str



It is very important that the file is closed in the end. This frees up resources and ensures consistency across different python versions.



```python
# Close file after finish

file1.close()
```

<h2 id="better">A Better Way to Open a File</h2>


Using the <code>with</code> statement is better practice, it automatically closes the file even if the code encounters an exception. The code will run everything in the indent block then close the file object.



```python
# Open file using with

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileContent = file1.read()
    print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The file object is closed, you can verify it by running the following cell:



```python
# Verify if the file is closed

file1.closed
```




    True



We can see the info in the file:



```python
# See the content of file

print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The syntax is a little confusing as the file object is after the <code>as</code> statement. We also don’t explicitly close the file. Therefore we summarize the steps in a figure:


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/ReadWith.png" width="500" />


We don’t have to read the entire file, for example, we can read the first 4 characters by entering three as a parameter to the method **.read()**:



```python
# Read first four characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
```

    This


Once the method <code>.read(4)</code> is called the first 4 characters are called. If we call the method again, the next 4 characters are called. The output for the following cell will demonstrate the process for different inputs to the method <code>read()</code>:



```python
# Read certain amount of characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))
```

    This
     is 
    line 1 
    
    This is line 2


The process is illustrated in the below figure, and each color represents the part of the file read after the method <code>read()</code> is called:


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/read.png" width="500" />


Here is an example using the same file, but instead we read 16, 5, and then 9 characters at a time:



```python
# Read certain amount of characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(16))
    print(file1.read(5))
    print(file1.read(9))
```

    This is line 1 
    
    This 
    is line 2


We can also read one line of the file at a time using the method <code>readline()</code>:



```python
# Read one line

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print("first line: " + file1.readline())
```

    first line: This is line 1 
    


We can also pass an argument to <code> readline() </code> to specify the number of charecters we want to read. However, unlike <code> read()</code>, <code> readline()</code> can only read one line at most.



```python
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.readline(20)) # does not read past the end of line
    print(file1.read(20)) # Returns the next 20 chars

```

    This is line 1 
    
    This is line 2
    This 


We can use a loop to iterate through each line:



```python
# Iterate through the lines

with open(example1,"r") as file1:
        i = 0;
        for line in file1:
            print("Iteration", str(i), ": ", line)
            i = i + 1
```

    Iteration 0 :  This is line 1 
    
    Iteration 1 :  This is line 2
    
    Iteration 2 :  This is line 3


We can use the method <code>readlines()</code> to save the text file to a list:



```python
# Read all lines and save as a list

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileasList = file1.readlines()
```

Each element of the list corresponds to a line of text:



```python
# Print the first line

FileasList[0]
```




    'This is line 1 \n'



# Print the second line

FileasList\[1]



```python
# Print the third line

FileasList[2]
```




    'This is line 3'
